## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip
- git

### Local Development

1. **Clone and setup:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/kn-sock.git
   cd kn-sock
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. **Install development tools:**

### Docker-based Development & Testing

- The project provides a `Dockerfile` for building a minimal Python environment with all dependencies.
- The `docker-compose.yml` orchestrates two services:
    - `knsock`: for running CLI commands
    - `test`: for running the test suite

**Common Docker commands:**

```bash
# Build the Docker image (uses Dockerfile)
docker-compose build

# Run CLI help
docker-compose run knsock

# Run all tests
docker-compose run test

# Run a specific test file
docker-compose run test pytest test/test_tcp_udp_msg.py -v

# Interactive development shell
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app knsock:latest bash
```

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)
- Maximum line length: 88 characters (Black formatter default)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add type hints to all public functions

### Code Formatting, Linting, and Type Checking

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/), [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/), and [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for code quality. All are managed via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks, configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

**To set up and use pre-commit hooks:**

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install  # Set up git hooks
pre-commit run --all-files  # Run on all files
```

This will automatically check formatting, linting, and types before you commit. See `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for details.

### Code Formatting

We use [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) for code formatting:

```bash
# Format all Python files
black kn_sock/ test/ examples/

# Check formatting without making changes
black --check kn_sock/ test/ examples/
```

### Linting

We use [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:

```bash
# Run linter
flake8 kn_sock/ test/ examples/
```

### Type Checking

We use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for type checking:

```bash
# Run type checker
mypy kn_sock/
```

---

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest -s test/

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=kn_sock test/

# Run specific test file
pytest test/test_tcp_udp_msg.py

# Run tests in parallel
pytest -n auto test/
```

### Writing Tests

- Write tests for all new functionality
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and failure cases
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Mock external dependencies when appropriate

### Test Structure

```python
def test_function_name():
    """Test description of what is being tested."""
    # Arrange
    expected = "expected result"

    # Act
    result = function_under_test()

    # Assert
    assert result == expected
```

---

## üìö Documentation Guidelines

### Docstrings

- Use Google-style docstrings
- Include type hints
- Provide usage examples
- Document all parameters and return values

Example:
```python
def send_tcp_message(host: str, port: int, message: str) -> None:
    """Send a message to a TCP server.

    Args:
        host: The target host address.
        port: The target port number.
        message: The message to send.

    Raises:
        ConnectionError: If connection fails.

    Example:
        >>> send_tcp_message("localhost", 8080, "Hello, World!")
    """
```

### README Updates

- Update README.md for new features
- Add usage examples
- Update installation instructions if needed
